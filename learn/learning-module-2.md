# Learning Module 2

Evaluating Entropy and Magnitude Using Planetary and Recursive Analogies

## Overview

This module introduces a structural approach to anomaly classification. It focuses on two dimensions:

* **Magnitude**: surface-level deviation
* **Entropy**: depth of structural unpredictability or resistance to compression

The module uses two tools to interpret these signals:

* Planet–moon system analogs
* Mandelbrot set iteration

This is a symbolic, model-relative framework, not a statistical one.

## Definitions

* Magnitude: How far a behavior deviates from an expected surface pattern.
* Entropy: How difficult it is to predict, compress, or model the behavior over time or under recursion.

Magnitude is visible in shallow resolution.
Entropy becomes visible only under repeated modeling or when viewed through nested system frames.

## Planetary Analogs for Outlier Types

System | Entropy | Magnitude | Interpretation
--- | --- | --- | ---
Rhea (Saturn) | Low | Low | Baseline; not structurally unusual
Io (Jupiter) | High | Medium | Internally unstable; structurally deviant
Earth–Moon | Medium | Low | Self-stabilizing in local system
Earth–Sun | Low | High | Externally controlled; reactive
Triton (Neptune) | High | High | Captured; unstable and disruptive
Janus–Epimetheus (Saturn) | Medium | Medium | Structurally coherent as a pair, but looks unstable in isolation

This table illustrates that anomalies may not resolve unless viewed as part of a system.

## Mandelbrot Set as Structural Filter

The Mandelbrot formula tests whether a point c remains bounded over iterations:

```
z₀ = 0  
zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + c
```

* If `|z|` becomes large, the behavior is divergent (reactive)
* If `|z|` remains bounded, the behavior is recursively stable (structural)

Behavior Type | Mandelbrot Outcome | Interpretation
--- | --- | ---
Explosive deviation | Rapid divergence | Reactive outlier
Recursive stability | Bounded complexity | Structural deviance
Edge instability | Shallow model volatility | Requires deeper analysis

This metaphor helps identify whether a behavior unfolds into pattern or escapes structure entirely.

## How to Evaluate Unknown Anomalies

Steps:
* Check Magnitude: Does it deviate strongly from surface expectations?
* Check Entropy: Can it be modeled recursively? Is it consistent across frames or contexts?
* Check Pairing or System Coupling: Does it behave differently when mirrored or paired? Is it inert? Captured? Co-stabilizing?

Optional: 
* Apply Mandelbrot Logic: Treat behavior as a seed and observe its output under iteration. Does it diverge, stabilize, or fluctuate?

## Summary

Condition | Classification
--- | ---
High magnitude, low entropy | Reactive outlier
High entropy, bounded behavior | Structural deviance
Unstable across all frames | Reactive outlier
Recursively stable in local subsystem | Misclassified systematic
Stable only when paired | Relational system outlier

## Notes

* Magnitude ≠ meaning; large deviations aren't always structurally deep.
* Entropy must be tested over time or through compression.
* Systems often misclassify outliers because the evaluation frame is too narrow.
* These tools are extensible and work across scientific, behavioral, and symbolic domains.
