*** Learning Module 1

* Nested Frames and Outlier Interaction

*** Overview

This module introduces a symbolic model for understanding different
types of outlier behavior using examples from physical systems. The goal
is to clarify how observed deviations may appear unstable or meaningful
depending on the frame of reference used. The material is aligned with a
structural classification approach that evaluates anomalies not just by
surface behavior, but by their recursive and relational properties.

Reactive and systematic are not absolute properties. They are relational
roles, assigned by system scale and model perspective.


** I. Earth's Behavior in Multiple Frames

Earth behaves differently depending on which system it's measured
within:

+----------------+----------------+------------------------------------+
| Earth–Moon     | Systematic     | Earth stabilizes the Moon's orbit  |
|                | Anchor         | and determines tidal behavior.     |
+----------------+----------------+------------------------------------+
| Earth–Sun      | Reactive       | Earth responds to solar gravity    |
|                | Participant    | and seasonal changes that it does  |
|                |                | not initiate.                      |
+----------------+----------------+------------------------------------+

**Implication:**

 - Classification depends on the system context. A body (or behavior)
   may be systematic in one frame but reactive in another.
 
 - This framing helps explain why some outliers appear volatile or
   misaligned when evaluated in a shallow or mismatched context.


** II. Moons as Reactivity Index

Moons in the solar system vary in behavior. This variation can be used
as a proxy to understand how different types of outliers behave across
domains.

Below is a simplified reactivity ranking of major moons in the solar
system, using a 1–10 scale where:

 - 1 = Highly systematic 
   (stable, predictable, tightly governed by host dynamics)

 - 10 = Highly reactive 
   (irregular, volatile, high entropy, low integration with host)

**The rankings consider:**

 - Orbital eccentricity and inclination
 - Tidal interaction
 - Geologic activity
 - Capture origin (vs. native formation)
 - Behavioral influence on host system

**Interpretation:**

 - High-reactivity moons resemble reactive outliers—visibly active,
   entropically unstable.
 - Low-reactivity moons resemble systematic signals—stable,
   low-deviation behaviors.

** III. Pairwise Outliers: Janus and Epimetheus

Two moons of Saturn—Janus and Epimetheus—switch orbits every few years.

This behavior appears anomalous individually but is stable when viewed
as a pair.

**Each cycle:**

 - They trade angular momentum
 - Their orbits invert without contact
 - The system resumes regular motion afterward

**Implication:**

 - Outliers that appear unstable in isolation may resolve as
   structurally valid in pairs.
 - The system only makes sense when analyzed across interactions, not
   parts.


** IV. Classification Principles from Planet–Moon Systems

**Key takeaways:**

 - System identity is frame-relative: a behavior may appear reactive in
   one system and systematic in another.

 - Behavior must be evaluated across nested contexts: Earth acts
   differently when judged by Moon–Earth vs. Sun–Earth dynamics.

 - Paired anomalies may reflect hidden structure: Janus and Epimetheus
   model recursive balance that fails surface classification.

 - Misclassification often happens at boundary conditions: when a model
   has low resolution relative to system complexity, outliers are
   misread.

** V. Applying to Classification

This module provides a way to reason through apparent anomalies:

 - Ask what frame or context is being used
 - Ask whether the system is nested inside a larger one
 - Ask whether interaction reveals more than single-point analysis

This does not resolve classification but creates conditions where
re-evaluation becomes possible.
