# Learning Modules

## Module 1: Planetary Analogy

System role depends on observer frame.

- Earth–Moon vs. Earth–Sun system
- Orbital roles as reactive/systematic analogues
- Structural identity as frame-relative

## Module 2: Entropy × Magnitude

Not all deviation is structurally deep; entropy tracks recursive unpredictability.

- Reactive vs. systematic deviance
- Epistemic cost of filtering
- Purpose of reclassification

## Module 3: Time and Magnitude

Outliers differ by visibility and duration; some reshape systems over time.

- Entropy as branching future
- Magnitude as surface force
- Time-layered deviance (e.g., precursors, slow forks)

## Module 4: Cross-Domain Outliers

Different domains interpret anomalies differently, often based on inherited tools rather than local structure.

- How outliers are treated in statistics, physics, ML, medicine, art, etc.
- Domain-specific misclassifications
- Structural impact of removal in each system

## Module 5: Outlier Shapes

Outliers can be objects, actions, or interpretation shifters; role misclassification is a source of drift.

- Noun/verb/adjective roles of deviance
- Role-based behavior
- Red Queen framing (model retraining as reaction to filtered deviance)
- Temporal misalignment (what's important only in hindsight)
