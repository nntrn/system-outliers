### Can the system tell the difference between a message that's important and one that's just intense?

**Test:**  
Try giving the system examples of messages that feel urgent or
emotional versus ones that seem deep but quiet.

**Why it matters:**  
This checks if the system can tell lasting meaning
apart from temporary intensity.

---

### Can the system spot when it doesn't understand something—but still treat it with care?

**Test:**  
Give it a message that doesn't clearly fit any category but
seems thoughtful or unfamiliar.

**Why it matters:**  
This checks whether the system respects uncertainty,
instead of rushing to mislabel or discard.

---

### Can it recognize when a message keeps showing up in different forms?

**Test:**  
Present a few messages that express the same idea in new ways.

**Why it matters:**  
This checks if the system knows that some ideas are
important because they keep coming back, not because they look familiar.

---

### Can it tell when it's reached the end of its own ability to make sense of things?

**Test:**  
Give it a message that doesn't fit and see if it can admit: "I
don't have a good category for this."

**Why it matters:**  
This helps verify whether the system knows when it
needs to pause or expand, rather than guess.

---

### Can the system tell when a message seems deep on the surface but actually doesn't go anywhere?

**Test:**  
Feed it messages that sound intellectual but don't lead to new
structure.

**Why it matters:**  
This tests whether the system can filter shallow
complexity—not just react to wordiness.

---

### Can it tell when a message is about to shift how the system thinks—before it actually does?

**Test:**  
Show it a message that sits right on the edge of changing the
system's categories.

**Why it matters:**  
This checks if the system can spot boundary stress
and get ready for change without collapsing.

---

### Can it handle messages that nobody knows what to do with—but that shouldn't be thrown away?

**Test:**  
Give it something strange, confusing, but not random—and see
if it stores it for later instead of rejecting it.

**Why it matters:**  
This checks the system's ability to hold open space
for the unknown.

---

### Can it react differently to the same message, depending on what the person or system receiving it knows?

**Test:**  
Present the same message to two versions of the system with
different background knowledge.

**Why it matters:**  
This checks whether meaning is treated as
context-dependent, not universal.

---

### Can the system tell when someone has stopped thinking—even though they're still producing answers?

**Test:**  
Give the system a user or model that outputs fluent responses
across multiple prompts. Check whether the structure of those responses
is actually changing—or if they're just repeating, rephrasing, or
relying on templates.

**Why it matters:**  
This tests whether the system is tracking whether
recursion is happening, not just whether something was generated.
