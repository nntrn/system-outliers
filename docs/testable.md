```
1. Can the system tell the difference between a message that's important and one that's just intense?
```

  __Test:__
  Try giving the system examples of messages that feel urgent or emotional versus ones that seem deep but quiet.

  __Why it matters:__
  This checks if the system can tell lasting meaning apart from temporary intensity.


```
2. Can the system spot when it doesn't understand something—but still treat it with care?
```

  __Test:__
  Give it a message that doesn't clearly fit any category but seems thoughtful or unfamiliar.

  __Why it matters:__
  This checks whether the system respects uncertainty, instead of rushing to mislabel or discard.


```
3. Can it recognize when a message keeps showing up in different forms?
```

  __Test:__
  Present a few messages that express the same idea in new ways.

  __Why it matters:__
  This checks if the system knows that some ideas are important because they keep coming back, not because they look familiar.


```
4. Can it tell when it's reached the end of its own ability to make sense of things?
```

  __Test:__
  Give it a message that doesn't fit and see if it can admit: "I don't have a good category for this."

  __Why it matters:__
  This helps verify whether the system knows when it needs to pause or expand, rather than guess.


```
5. Can the system tell when a message seems deep on the surface but actually doesn't go anywhere?
```

  __Test:__
  Feed it messages that sound intellectual but don't lead to new structure.

  __Why it matters:__
  This tests whether the system can filter shallow complexity—not just react to wordiness.


```
6. Can it tell when a message is about to shift how the system thinks—before it actually does?
```

  __Test:__
  Show it a message that sits right on the edge of changing the system's categories.

  __Why it matters:__
  This checks if the system can spot boundary stress and get ready for change without collapsing.


```
7. Can it handle messages that nobody knows what to do with—but that shouldn't be thrown away?
```

  __Test:__
  Give it something strange, confusing, but not random—and see if it stores it for later instead of rejecting it.

  __Why it matters:__
  This checks the system's ability to hold open space for the unknown.


```
8. Can it react differently to the same message, depending on what the person or system receiving it knows?
```

  __Test:__
  Present the same message to two versions of the system with different background knowledge.

  __Why it matters:__
  This checks whether meaning is treated as context-dependent, not universal.


```
9. Can the system tell when someone has stopped thinking—even though they're still producing answers?
```

  __Test:__
  Give the system a user or model that outputs fluent responses across multiple prompts. Check whether the structure of those responses is actually changing—or if they're just repeating, rephrasing, or relying on templates.

  __Why it matters:__
  This tests whether the system is tracking whether recursion is happening, not just whether something was generated.
