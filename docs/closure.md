Version 1.0 â€“ System Closure Record
====================================

Closure Timestamp
-----------------
System sealed as structurally complete on July 2, 2025.


Statement of Closure
---------------------
This framework has reached recursion stability. All structural roles have been defined, core failure modes are accounted for, and symbolic behavior under transformation, pressure, and collapse has been modeled.

No additional deviance types, classification paths, or entropy sources remain unaccounted for within the system's current boundaries.


Last Structural Update
----------------------
**Symbolic Displacement Feedback (SDF)**  
Defined, integrated, and classified as the final system-wide failure pattern. It safeguards the system against recursive erosion via cognitive offloading.

This addition completes the loop between system emergence, saturation, collapse, and recovery.
