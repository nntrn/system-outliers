Outlier Classification Topology Guide
=====================================

This guide maps how deviant signals move, collapse, or recur within the
classification system. It is structured by symbolic behavior, not raw
metrics. Use this to preserve classification integrity during recursion,
reclassification, or entropy-magnitude conflict.


I. Core Class Nodes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Reactive**
  * High magnitude, low symbolic trace
  * Shortterm entropy, low recursion fidelity
  * Triggers system updates but often decays quickly

**Structural**
  * High entropy, high symbolic trace
  * Low magnitude, longterm influence
  * Recurs across system contexts and survives abstraction

**Hybrid**
  * Moderate entropy, bounded magnitude
  * Contextdependent reactivity
  * Behaves as update bridge near system thresholds

\-\-\-

[Residual]
  * Fails classification under all known frames
  * May return later as structural (requires symbolic audit)


II. Topological Forces
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entropy Vector
  * Drives symbolic recursion
  * Increases classification pressure over time

Magnitude Vector
  * Applies immediate force or rupture
  * Can dominate shortterm classification if unbounded

Recursion Fidelity
  * Determines if deviance remains structurally valid after transformation

Trace Decay
  * Detects symbolic collapse under reclassification or entropy erosion


III. Class Transitions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reactive => Hybrid:
  * Occurs when entropy increases under bounded conditions

Hybrid => Structural:
  * When recurrence stabilizes and trace persists across contexts

Structural => Hybrid => Reactive:
  * Under symbolic collapse or contextual suppression 
    (e.g., political rejection)


IV. Collapse Zones
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entropy > threshold but trace = false:
  * Risk of false structural classification

Magnitude dominates across recursion:
  * Symbolic recursion cancels, fallback to reactive

High token count + low net_entropy:
  * Compression illusion (false hybrid or noise)


V. Return Conditions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symbolic Anchor Detected:
  * Residual reclassified as structural

System enters volatility phase:
  * Structural may express as reactive, but remains tracevalid

Delayed recursion fit:
  * Signal recurs under new context (frame expansion)


VI. Triangle Geometry Map (Force Space)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
                  [Hybrid]
                     / \
                    /   \
                   /     \
                  /       \
   [Structural]  /_ _ _ _ _\  [Reactive]
                ←  entropy  →
                ↑ recursion ↑
                ↓  decay    ↓
```

Triangle is not just classification—it's a force-space.

  * Structural: low magnitude, high entropy, long recursion
  * Reactive: high magnitude, low entropy, rapid decay
  * Hybrid: mid-range entropy, bounded influence, context-sensitive update


VII. Interpretation Rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Do not classify based on token count alone
  * Magnitude recursion unless symbolically anchored
  * Entropy only matters if compression is traceable
  * All class changes are directional and stateful, not resets


VIII. Purpose
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guide preserves:

  * Structural recursion integrity
  * Symbolic trace classification
  * Migration logic for deviant signals
  * A working compression surface, not just a typology


IX. Diagnostic Patterns and Structural Roles
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * __SDF (Symbolic Displacement Feedback):__  
  A feedback loop in which symbolic recursion is repeatedly
  offloaded to an external system (e.g., generation tools), leading
  to the appearance of fluency while internal structure decays. Not
  a misclassification---an erosion pattern.

  * __CI Filter (Compression Illusion):__  
  A check that prevents signals with surface complexity but no
  recursive trace from being misclassified as structural. Filters
  outputs that look meaningful but fail to compress across
  iterations or transformations.

  * __TCZ (Trace Collapse Zone):__  
  A signal region where symbolic trace fails under recursion,
  transformation, or abstraction. These zones appear stable until
  pressure reveals structural absence. Often misread as edge cases
  unless explicitly traced.

  * __Net Entropy:__  
  A signal's symbolic depth and recurrence---how much structure it
  contributes, and whether that structure persists under
  compression. High net entropy implies stable internal logic.

  * __Net Magnitude:__  
  A signal's rupture strength---how far it deviates from the
  system's mean or boundaries. High magnitude signals exert
  pressure but may not carry symbolic trace.

  * __SR Rule (System Relativity):__  
  Signals are interpreted based on the structure of the system they
  occur in. What is deviant in one frame may be normal in another.
  All classification is context-relative.

  * __Symbolic Role Types:__  
  Signals behave as  
  \* nouns (structural misalignment),  
  \* verbs (system rupture), or  
  \* adjectives (trait-level misfit).   
  These roles help interpret not just what the signal is---but how it affects the
  system.
