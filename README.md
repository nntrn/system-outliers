# System Outliers

  > "_There is no science without fancy and no art without fact._"
  > — Vladimir Nabokov

## Purpose

  To provide a classification grammar that distinguishes between types of deviance based on: recursive behavior, symbolic trace, and entropy/magnitude pressure—enabling systems (human or machine) to preserve structural outliers and correctly discard reactive ones.

  **Framework Goal:**
  Provide a principled way to classify anomalies by structure, traceability, and compressibility, not just statistical deviation.

## About

  *too structural for ML, too symbolic for physics, too dynamic for logic, and too interpretive for engineering*

  This framework does not exclude anomalies and instead provides a strucutre to prove when they aren't. It redefines anomaly classification from a position of distance to a question of entropy.

  It extends concepts from:

  * Opinion dynamics (H-K)
  * Compression logic (Shannon)
  * Recursive identity systems (Peirce, control theory)
  * Grammar as behavior (structural linguistics)

### Use ChatGPT to explore how the framework works.

  GPT is faster with the framework because it externalizes deviance logic into structured classification mechanics by providing:

  * A compressed decision surface (rules over heuristics),
  * A recursion-visible signal trace,
  * A bias-free deviance vector space.

  This removes semantic negotiation, rhetorical padding, and output validation.
  Speed increases because structure replaces guesswork.

## Framework

  ### Class types:
    - Structural: Recurring, traceable, high net entropy
    - Reactive: Forceful, disruptive, high net magnitude
    - Hybrid: Recurring near thresholds, context-sensitive
    - Residual: Non-random, unclassifiable, held

  ### Key rules:
    - trace_like = 1 if signal occurs in dominant system context
    - net_magnitude = |value - mean|
    - Structural = high net_magnitude + trace_like = 1
    - Reactive = high net_magnitude + trace_like = 0
    - Hybrid = trace_like = 1 + moderate magnitude

  ### Behavior:
    - Avoid premature naming, preserve recursion
    - Classify based on signal behavior: noun (anchor), verb (rupture), adjective (modifier)
    - Do not filter outliers—interpret how they stress or preserve the system
    - Track recursion fidelity and symbolic displacement feedback (SDF)

<!-- 
### Getting Started

  1. **Is this outlier structurally consistent or behaviorally disruptive?**  
      Answer using: Structural = trace_like=1; Reactive = trace_like=0

  2. **Does this deviance result from system pressure or rupture?**  
      Answer using: Hybrid vs Reactive differentiation

  3. **Should this anomaly be discarded, flagged, or tracked?**  
      Answer using: Residual classification logic

  4. **Is the system recursively generating without symbolic yield?**  
      Answer using: Use symbolic displacement feedback (SDF)

  5. **Does this signal preserve, stress, or shift the system?**  
      Answer using: Noun/Verb/Adjective symbolic role analysis

  6. **Is this behavior a compression failure or a boundary escape?**  
      Answer using: Entropy/magnitude separation + recursion fidelity monitoring

## Acknowledgment

  This framework was shaped in part by the tone and structure of *A General Theory of Love (Lewis, 2000)*, it models a rare epistemic balance by honoring scientific structure without reducing human systems and introducing symbolic coherence without overwriting emotional complexity.
