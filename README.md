# System Outliers

> "_There is no science without fancy and no art without fact._"

## About

This project emerged from a realization that outliers exists as their system inside a broader system. It follows the lead of domains that already treat outliers as structurally informative rather than dismissible. 

It extends concepts from:

  * Opinion dynamics (H-K)
  * Compression logic (Shannon)
  * Recursive identity systems (Peirce, control theory)
  * Grammar as behavior (structural linguistics)


## Framework

This isn't a restatement of anomaly detection. It's a behavioral-symbolic deviance architecture that:

  * Rejects fixed statistical boundaries
  * Models outlier behavior under symbolic strain
  * Introduces symbolic roles (N/V/Adj) as active classification cues
  * Tracks system-relative context (trace_like)
  * Preserves semantically recursive deviance rather than discarding it

---

| Question | How This Framework Answers It | 
| -------- | ----------------------------  | 
| Is this outlier structurally consistent or behaviorally disruptive? | Structural = trace_like=1;<br>Reactive = trace_like=0 | 
| Does this deviance result from system pressure or rupture? | Hybrid vs Reactive differentiation | 
| Should this anomaly be discarded, flagged, or tracked? | Residual classification logic | 
| Is the system recursively generating without symbolic yield? | Use symbolic displacement feedback (SDF) | 
| Does this signal preserve, stress, or shift the system? | Noun/Verb/Adjective symbolic role analysis | 
| Is this behavior a compression failure or a boundary escape? | Entropy/magnitude separation + recursion fidelity monitoring | 


## Getting Started

Drop in [system-outliers-annie.txt](system-outliers-annie.txt) into ChatGPT 

[![](docs/usage-chatgpt.png)](https://github.com/nntrn/system-outliers)

This framework gives GPT everything it need to:

  * Build interpretable outlier classifiers
  * Handle symbolic overload
  * Route ambiguous or edge signals into structurally meaningful categories
  * Monitor system saturation, recursion decay, and meaning preservation


## Acknowledgment

This framework was shaped in part by the tone and structure of *A General Theory of Love (Lewis, 2000)*, it models a rare epistemic balance by honoring scientific structure without reducing human systems and introducing symbolic coherence without overwriting emotional complexity

Developed collaboratively through recursive interaction with ChatGPT.
