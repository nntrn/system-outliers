## I. CORE OBJECTIVE

To classify, structure, and transform system outliers by mapping their symbolic behavior, entropy, and magnitude into a geometric force space. This framework does not exclude anomalies but assigns them structure, role, and potential transformation paths.

## II. CLASS ONTOLOGY (Type Assignment Layer)

Type | Trace | Entropy | Magnitude | Function
:--- | --- | --- | --- | :---
Structural | High | High | Low | Stable system anchor; recurs across transformations
Reactive | Low | Low | High | Disruptive trigger; decays quickly
Hybrid | Medium | Moderate | Moderate | Threshold agent; context-sensitive
Residual | None | Variable | Variable | Temporarily unclassifiable; potential future anchor

Outlier status is contextual, never permanent. Classification is adjectival, not ontological.

## III. SYMBOLIC GEOMETRY

A force space triangle with axes:

* Entropy (E): symbolic recursion pressure
* Magnitude (M): force strength or rupture
* Trace Fidelity (T): ability to preserve identity across transformations

Each signal occupies a point in this triangle based on:

* E = degree of internal symbolic recursion
* M = immediate disruptive force
* T = persistence under structural transformation

### Transitions

* **Reactive => Hybrid**: entropy rises under bounded magnitude

* **Hybrid => Structural**: trace persists across contexts

* **Residual => Structural**: triggered by external interpretive override

* **Structural => Reactive**: trace collapse or suppression cascade


## IV. SYSTEM DYNAMICS

### Forces

Force | Function
:--- | :---
Entropy Vector | Drives symbolic recursion
Magnitude Vector | Drives signal rupture or pressure
Trace Decay | Monitors symbolic collapse

### Diagnostic Collapse Conditions

Collapse Zone | Effect
:--- | :---
High E + No Trace | False structural classification risk
Dominant M + Weak Recursion | Forced reversion to Reactive
High Token Count + Low E | Compression Illusion (false Hybrid)


## V. VARIABLE DEFINITIONS

Variable | Type | Function
:--- | --- | :---
`net_magnitude` | Scalar | Distance from system equilibrium
`net_entropy` | Scalar | Symbolic recursion depth
`trace_like` | Binary | Structural alignment proxy


## VI. UPDATE LOGIC

* Signals move in triangle space as net_entropy or net_magnitude change

* System states can reset, collapse, or enter volatility phases

* Classification is frame-sensitive: same signal can be Structural in one frame, Residual in another


## VII. USE CASE DOMAINS

Domain | Application
:--- | :---
LLM Trace Analysis | Detecting symbolic anomalies in long-form output
Social Dynamics | Modeling fringe ideas becoming stable narratives
Scientific Drift | Identifying misfit data that stabilizes over time
Network Security | Structuring signal misalignment as recoverable classes


## VIII. EXAMPLE CLASSIFICATION 

Signal: Sudden concept in discourse ("gravity as information")

    Initial scoring:
    * net_entropy: medium
    * net_magnitude: low
    * trace_like: false
    
    Initial classification: Residual
    
    * Not structurally aligned
    * No immediate disruption
    * Low recurrence
    
    Over time:
    * Recurs in adjacent system's
    * Trace increases
    * trace_like becomes true
    
    Reclassified: Hybrid → Structural

* Stability achieved through context expansion
* Now treated as theory generator
