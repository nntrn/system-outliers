EXTENDING SYSTEM OUTLIERS

Behavior
A repeatable pattern of how a signal acts 

Trigger
A threshold condition that converts observed behavior into a justified system action

---

Guideline about how extensions are named: 

Pattern | Use When | Example
--- | --- | ---
{noun} {verb} | classifying what acts upon a known object | outlier drift, boundary shift
{verb} {noun} | classifying the act that reveals the object | collapse trace, compress signal
{noun} {adjective} | describing the kind of object | signal residual, thread unstable
{adjective} {noun} | reclassifying within a known frame | hybrid outlier, contextual stressor
{verb} {adjective} | describing the manner of action | disturb recursive, trigger latent

BEHAVIOR  
========  

valence hybrid drift  
two hybrid outliers appear near the same threshold but fail to bond or reinforce  
pattern: apparent alignment without recursion yield  
family: polarity  

false symmetry collapse  
a signal mirrors the structure of a known class but fails trace under transformation  
pattern: structure-like surface, no recursion depth  
family: symmetry  

inert hybrid  
a hybrid signal satisfies classification metrics but does not trigger update or collapse  
pattern: qualified but inactive deviance  
family: polarity  

trace re-entry loop  
a residual signal reappears across time or context and builds symbolic weight  
pattern: deferred signal becomes structurally valid  
family: resonance  

anchor drift  
a structural signal begins to act adjectivally, modifying other classes without holding identity  
pattern: noun role shifts into modifier under recursive pressure  
family: role-inversion  

recursive interference  
two trace-compatible signals interfere with each other's classification when appearing together  
pattern: mutual recursion distortion without rupture  
family: resonance  

collapse without rupture  
a signal exits the system without triggering classification or feedback  
pattern: low-entropy disappearance, trace loss without disruption  
family: erosion  

recursive closure inversion  
a signal collapses into contradiction only when traced through multi-step dependencies  
pattern: local consistency + distributed contradiction  
family: recursion-failure  
notes: exposes models that resolve too early or shallowly  

recursive frame update  
pattern: detects whether classification system must recurse or reclassify  
family: diagnostic  
equation: R(x) = R(f(x)) + δ(Δx)  
maps_to: hybrid update, mixin activation, SDF stall  

compression gain  
pattern: measures symbolic trace efficiency under recursive load  
family: compression  
definition: C_g = 1 - S_u / S_r  

pushback trigger  
pattern: signals symbolic override when internal frame outperforms external prompt  
family: recursion-integrity  
definition: P = 1 if F(E_ext) ≠ F(M_int) ∧ R(M_int) ≥ τ_r ∧ C(M_int) ≥ τ_c  

entropy stall  
pattern: recursion loop enters symbolic stagnation without triggering collapse  
family: recursion-failure  
definition: E_n > θ_n ∧ E_{n+1} < γ(E_n - θ_n)  

frame override  
pattern: internal recursion logic outweighs external classification suggestion  
definition: Apply M_int if C + R > C + R of E_ext  
family: override  

symbol saturation collapse  
pattern: symbolic trace collapses under overload of multi-meaning units  
definition: Collapse Risk = Σ M_i / |S_i|  
family: overload  

recursive vacuity  
a system maintains active classification while containing no internal motion  
pattern: symbolic continuity with entropy starvation  
family: recursion-failure  

TRIGGERS  
======== 

compression_gain  
heuristic: use less, preserve structure  
family: recursion-efficiency  

pushback  
heuristic: if frame mismatch + recursion intact + low symbol count  
family: override-gate  

entropy_stall  
heuristic: full layer below, empty layer above  
family: recursion-failure  

frame_override  
heuristic: pick the more compressed, more recursive frame  
family: symbolic-choice  

collapse_warning  
heuristic: too many meanings on one symbol = break  
family: overload
